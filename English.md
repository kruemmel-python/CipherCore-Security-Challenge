CipherCore Security Challenge üîí
Welcome to the CipherCore Security Challenge! This challenge gives you the chance to test your skills on a state-of-the-art encryption method designed to resist all common attack techniques.

About the Challenge
In this repository, you will find a file, testdatei.txt.optimiert, encrypted using a unique system. The encryption is not bound by mathematical principles and uses innovative security mechanisms, making it nearly impossible for even skilled hackers to decrypt the contents without the correct key.

Your goal: Try to decrypt the contents of the file!

Background
This encryption was designed to protect data against all conventional decryption methods. It is a multi-layered security architecture using new and creative approaches. The file content is plain text but cannot be read without additional software.

Rules
This challenge is strictly for testing purposes.
The file's content must not be used for commercial or illegal purposes.
Please do not share specific information about the file's possible contents in this repository; share only general feedback on your methods and approaches.
Notes
The file is encrypted so that traditional mathematical decryption methods will not succeed.
If you manage to read the contents, please submit your approach through a pull request or an issue. Feedback on difficulty level and suggestions for improvement are also welcome.
